The Iran-aligned Houthis detained the additional U.N. staff on Thursday, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, and Guterres calls for the immediate release of all those detained.

"These detentions render the delivery of UN humanitarian assistance in Houthi-controlled areas untenable. This directly affects millions of people in need and limits their access to life-saving assistance," Dujarric said.

The United Nations has repeatedly rejected Houthi accusations that U.N. staff or U.N. operations in Yemen were involved in spying.

Houthis have controlled most of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, since seizing power in 2014 and early 2015.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UNDYDV3PAZPFFPC52ETQJ3NBXM.jpg?auth=7e9486087a35a4f1c03663f6a58353e67e9b66802b886ed4c5d03c4480e90a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Another 2 accused sent to jail over attack on Prothom Alo building</title><link>https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/another-2-accused-sent-jail-over-attack-prothom-alo-building-1320001</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:40:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/another-2-accused-sent-jail-over-attack-prothom-alo-building-1320001</guid><description>Following a petition by police, Metropolitan Magistrate Didarul Alam passed the order after the accused were produced before the court.</description><enclosure url="https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_1/public/images/2025/12/19/597695656_1957734165162575_8036458173788894159_n.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Jatiyo Party announces candidates for 243 seats</title><link>https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/politics/jatiyo-party-announces-candidates-243-seats-1319996</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:40:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/politics/jatiyo-party-announces-candidates-243-seats-1319996</guid><description>Announcing the candidates, party Secretary General Shamim Haider Patwary said they may withdraw from the election if a level playing field is not ensured</description><enclosure url="https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_1/public/images/2023/12/06/jatiya_party_manju.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>District Judge Court staff found dead in Feni</title><link>https://www.daily-sun.com/bangladesh/847590/district-judge-court-staff-found-dead-in-feni</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:58:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.daily-sun.com/bangladesh/847590/district-judge-court-staff-found-dead-in-feni</guid><description>The deceased was identified as Enamul Haque, son of the late Fazlul Haque of Nagarkanda village in Panch Gachia union</description><enclosure url="https://dscdn.daily-sun.com/english/uploads/news_photos/2025/12/22/medium/Dead-69479dcd9eae3-694985bfdf53d.gif" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>England snap 15-year losing streak to win chaotic 4th Ashes Test</title><link>https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/286346/england-snap-15-year-losing-streak-to-win-chaotic-4th-ashes-test</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/286346/england-snap-15-year-losing-streak-to-win-chaotic-4th-ashes-test</guid><description>A fighting England won their first Test on Australian soil in 15 years Saturday, restoring their battered pride with a gutsy four-wicket victory to clinch a chaotic fourth Ashes clash that was all over inside two days.

Umerov, who is in the United States for the talks, also said on the Telegram messaging app that Kyiv's European partners would be involved.

"We are constructively minded. We have already held preliminary consultations with our European colleagues and are preparing for further discussions with the American side," Umerov said. "... Ukraine’s security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term."

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is pushing to bring an end to nearly four years of the war.

White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, held talks in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine and the United States had agreed on several documents, including a 20-point peace framework, and security guarantees and a reconstruction plan for Ukraine. But he said that no aligned final proposals had been agreed, adding that the territorial issues remained unresolved.

Russian President Vladimir Putin offered no compromise on Friday on his terms for ending the war in Ukraine, saying the onus was on Ukraine and Europe to make the next move.

Witkoff and Kushner also plan to meet a Russian delegation in Miami this weekend, a White House official said.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOYJ47LZOZKWFE4JWXAKD7J4FQ.jpg?auth=349cf9c95b1eeb5c4d8e3ab73b7c3cbbf1a9e9928136c6efae6b28c5a06d2f42&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN aims to fix budget rule cutting cash availability amid crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-aims-fix-budget-rule-cutting-cash-availability-amid-crisis-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:29:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-aims-fix-budget-rule-cutting-cash-availability-amid-crisis-2025-12-19/</guid><description>GENEVA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.N. officials are hoping to overhaul a "bizarre" rule that could see the global body credit hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent dues to states next year, even as it faces fears of bankruptcy.

Under U.N. financial regulations, any money unspent, often because states paid too late or not at all, is automatically subtracted from their future dues.

This means the global body would have to credit members nearly $300 million next year, U.N. officials say, reducing by close to 10% the planned budget of $3.2 billion.

Tatiana Valovaya, director general of the U.N. in Geneva, called the rule "bizarre", saying reforms have been sought for years but so far have not succeeded.

"The organisation has to return to the member states the money which it hasn't received, and that could make our situation for the year 2026 even more difficult," she told reporters this week.

The U.N. is already facing a 15% budget reduction as it seeks to cut costs in its 80th year amid a cash crisis, driven largely by arrears from top contributor the United States.

A decision is set to be made on reforming the rule as part of ongoing talks on the 2026 budget, with the General Assembly set to make a decision before year-end, a U.N. spokesperson told Reuters.

U.N. fees are based on the size of each of its 193 members' economies. Observers say the rule made sense when countries paid their dues punctually and in full but as of December 15 only 148 had done so, a U.N. website showed.

Many fear U.S. President Donald Trump will not pay the U.S.' outstanding fees after criticising the body.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is seeking to temporarily suspend the return of credits as part of the budget package, a U.N. document showed. In October, he estimated the amount to be credited to states will rise to $600 million in 2027 based on unspent funds from 2025.

"That means a race to bankruptcy," he said.

U.N. finances expert Ronny Patz called it a "runaway crisis". "We are getting to a point where core functions cannot be performed and that impacts everything that depends on the Secretariat," he said.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/POO452ZMVBO2ROK43GPHADGWQQ.jpg?auth=ec62b5da5bb75a27d4a3fa16dcd4affa2f6989fd947751581be939bc8b48b43a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World Court to hear Myanmar genocide case in January</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/world-court-hear-myanmar-genocide-case-january-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:27:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/world-court-hear-myanmar-genocide-case-january-2025-12-19/</guid><description>THE HAGUE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The International Court of Justice will hear a landmark case accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against its minority Muslim group, the Rohingya, on January 12-29, the United Nations' top court said on Friday.

The proceedings are expected to set precedents that could affect South Africa’s case against Israel over the war in Gaza, as this will be the first genocide case the ICJ has heard on its merits in more than a decade.

In the first week of the hearings, Gambia -- a predominantly Muslim West African country -- will outline its case from January 12 to 15. Backed by the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, Gambia filed the case at the ICJ in 2019, accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya.

Myanmar, which has denied genocide , can present its side from January 16 to January 20.

In an unusual move, the Court -- also known as the World Court -- has also allocated three days for hearing witnesses. These hearings will be closed to the public and media.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingya into neighbouring Bangladesh had included "genocidal acts".

Myanmar rejected the U.N. findings as "biased and flawed". It says its crackdown was aimed at Rohingya rebels who had carried out attacks.

The case is being brought under the 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, which defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".

Both Myanmar and Gambia have signed the Genocide Convention, which gives the top U.N. court jurisdiction in the case.

Acts of genocide named in the convention include killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the group in whole or in part.

Since the 1948 Genocide Convention, the ICJ has only confirmed one episode of genocide, the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Bosnian Serb troops during the 1990s war that tore apart the former Yugoslavia.

The findings of the ICJ in this case could become important in any future genocide case, specifically as Gambia and a number of intervening states in the case including Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom have argued that genocide is not limited to only mass killings.

The intervening countries said in written filings that the court should not only focus on the number of dead to establish genocidal intent, but also look at forced displacement, crimes against children and sexual and gender-based crimes.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCLK5Z3RJJJWJOJS5XOTMSP76Q.jpg?auth=4aaa199d2bd9e533c989820dcf619ed6f011dabea9c8d86703ff84b450cee41f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey finds Russian Orlan-10 drone in northwestern city – interior ministry</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-finds-russian-orlan-10-drone-northwestern-city-interior-ministry-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:45:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-finds-russian-orlan-10-drone-northwestern-city-interior-ministry-2025-12-19/</guid><description>ANKARA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday it had found a Russian-origin Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicle in the northwestern city of Kocaeli, the Interior Ministry said.

A U.S.-brokered peace deal was signed in June between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, yet fighting between the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels and the Congolese army has continued around the eastern town of Uvira.

Rwanda denies supporting M23 and has blamed Congolese and Burundian forces for the renewed fighting. A report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that Rwanda exercised command and control over the rebels.

"Thousands of people crossing the border on foot and by boats each day have overwhelmed local resources, creating a major humanitarian emergency that requires immediate global support," UNHCR said in a statement.

UNHCR's Burundi representative Brigitte Mukanga-eno told reporters in Geneva that boats full of refugees were arriving daily across Lake Tanganyika from the affected South Kivu area around Uvira despite pledges by M23 to withdraw.

Some of the boats are in poor condition, she said, and one capsized this week, drowning those aboard.

She described inadequate conditions in Burundi's camps with long queues forming for limited food and water supplies and poor sanitary conditions leading to cholera outbreaks.

One refugee, Mapendo Malahaba, a 50-year-old mother of seven in Burundi's Gatumba refugee reception centre, told Reuters last week she had become separated from her children while fleeing.

Another refugee named Anzuruni at the same centre complained of resource shortages and open defecation nearby.

"We have no drinks, no toilets. The population is suffering...it's catastrophic," he said.

Burundi, one of the world's poorest countries, has launched an appeal for $35 million to help meet the immediate needs, UNHCR's Mukanga-eno said, but prospects are uncertain with many international donors cutting aid sharply this year.

"We really hope that with the flash appeal, there will be some response as soon as possible, to avoid the conditions going from bad to worse," she said.

Earlier this year, the same conflict in Congo prompted 70,000 to flee to Burundi in what was then the biggest influx in decades and only half of them have since returned, UNHCR said.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SZVZQRV4MJIIFE6DOB65P6CT64.jpg?auth=4eaacaacfca1f71de9ab3c577b3d8a5190c6fa560dee6eb2cc01ab44f1822f42&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon-Israel truce committee talks widen as Hezbollah disarmament deadline nears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-israel-truce-committee-talks-widen-hezbollah-disarmament-deadline-nears-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:36:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-israel-truce-committee-talks-widen-hezbollah-disarmament-deadline-nears-2025-12-19/</guid><description>BEIRUT, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The committee overseeing the Hezbollah-Israel truce in Lebanon focused on Friday on how to return displaced people to their homes, addressing civilian issues to help prevent renewed war if a year-end deadline to disarm Hezbollah is not met.

The 15th meeting of the committee reflected a long-standing U.S. push to broaden talks between the sides beyond monitoring the 2024 ceasefire, in line with President Donald Trump's agenda of cementing peace deals across the volatile Middle East.

Israel has publicly urged Lebanese authorities to fulfil a commitment under the truce to disarm Hezbollah, warning that it would act "as necessary" if Lebanon does not take steps against the Iran-aligned proxy militia.

At Friday's meeting in the south Lebanon coastal town of Naqoura, civilian participants discussed steps to support safe returns of residents uprooted by the 2023-24 war and advance economic reconstruction, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said.

A source familiar with the discussions told Reuters they also addressed disputes over how to limit weaponry south of the Litani River and deploying the Lebanese army into Hezbollah's stronghold region.

The Lebanese and Israeli participants agreed that durable political and economic progress was essential to reinforcing security gains and ensuring long-term stability and prosperity, the U.S. Embassy added in a statement.

The committee added that a strengthened Lebanese army, which participants described as the guarantor of security south of the Litani River but was for many years outgunned by Hezbollah, was critical to sustaining stability.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun affirmed the priority of returning residents of border villages to their homes, a presidency statement said, adding that the committee would reconvene on January 7.

Lebanon and Israel have been officially enemy states for more than 70 years. Since the U.S.-brokered truce, the two sides have traded accusations of violations while Israel has continued to carry out strikes that have killed hundreds, saying it is targeting Hezbollah attempts to rebuild military capabilities.

At the committee's December 3 meeting, the first including civilians from both sides, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said he hoped civilian participation would help defuse tensions.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said then the atmosphere at the meeting was good and that the sides agreed to put forth ideas for economic cooperation, but that Hezbollah must be disarmed regardless.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VGLB55VLTFPQTLWIOATFJAHTVA.jpg?auth=7eca767a26cc718bf61b08403a4cb9c2380276bca93d2acf3cab6e27dd42e0ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin promises to look into case of jailed Frenchman Laurent Vinatier</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-promises-look-into-case-jailed-frenchman-laurent-vinatier-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:36:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-promises-look-into-case-jailed-frenchman-laurent-vinatier-2025-12-19/</guid><description>MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he would look into the case of Laurent Vinatier, a French researcher jailed for violating Russia's "foreign agent" laws.

The chaotic elections have been rocked by a fumbled vote tallying process, allegations of fraud and U.S. intervention.

Where does the vote count stand?

Conservative Nasry Asfura of the National Party is ahead of the center-right candidate Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal Party by around 43,000 votes, out of more than 3 million cast. But there are still hundreds of thousands of votes that have not been counted due to inconsistencies with the tally sheets. On Thursday, Honduras' National Electoral Council finally began the process of overseeing a manual count of those votes.
What are the protests about?
Protesters, mainly linked to the ruling leftist LIBRE party, say the election has been marred by fraud and are demanding a full manual recount of the more than three million ballots cast. The electoral body has said the protests - some of which took place outside the offices where tally sheets are being stored - made it impossible to start the manual count of the roughly 15% of votes with inconsistencies, leading to days of delays. The candidate for the LIBRE party, Rixi Moncada, is a distant third in the vote count. Nasralla has also called for a full recount. The president of Honduras' electoral council says a vote-by-vote recount is not necessary because there is no concrete evidence of irregularities.
How did we get here?
While the election day vote on November 30 went fairly smoothly, the tallying of the votes has been plagued by problems. The company hired to oversee the process delayed the vote count multiple times in order to conduct maintenance on its software. The delays, as well as the large number of inconsistent tally sheets, have fueled concerns of tampering in a country with a history of electoral fraud allegations. The European Union and the Organization of American States have criticized the delays in the vote count but have not raised concerns of systematic fraud.
What are the next steps?
Honduras’ electoral council has until December 30 to certify the election. The electoral council is overseen by three officials representing each of the major political parties. At least two of the three representatives have to agree to certify the election result. If they fail to do so, it will fall to Honduras’ Congress to certify the result. If Congress fails to recognize the results, it could extend President Xiomara Castro's term for up to two more years and call for new elections.
What is the United States’ role in the elections?
U.S. involvement has overshadowed the election and triggered complaints of improper interference. U.S. President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Asfura and suggested U.S. support of Honduras is conditional on Asfura winning. Trump also alleged possible fraud in the election, without providing evidence. The U.S. Department of State has called for a quick resolution of the manual count and the announcement of final results.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RUCLRWKS5BJKTC4DIUOKPDH4ZI.jpg?auth=9021b14351ac4de350fc12a6025e9b2e4738fc8795d723e025c0c3466a3973c8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Return of immigration raids brings fear to ‘Mexican Capital of the Midwest’</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/return-immigration-raids-brings-fear-mexican-capital-midwest-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/return-immigration-raids-brings-fear-mexican-capital-midwest-2025-12-19/</guid><description>By Reuters Photography Staff

The Trump administration’s deportation surge has rattled America’s third-largest city, but it has devastated the historic Mexican enclave of Little Village

Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming of age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl’s 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.

The first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named “Operation Midway Blitz,” racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.

The return of roving U.S. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a  large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.

At Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents..

Business struggles to make rent

“We’re going to suffer again as businesses,” Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.”

A DHS spokesperson did not respond directly when asked about the impact of the raids on local businesses.

Even before Bovino’s return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.

The tourists who came to the ‘Mexican Capital of the Midwest’ to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went into hiding.

“It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.

In her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.

As the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.

“They’ve broken into the neighborhood again,” she said. “It’s definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn’t something that we were expecting.”

A neighborhood’s commercial heart

Roxana’s salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.

Before the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.

But anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.

Two shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.

Evelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can’t sleep at night right now, and during the day I’m always freaking out.”

Maria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.

The family left behind

For one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.

“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,” she said.

Asked for comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said:  “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking the law.”

The cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.

“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.

“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”

Resistance

On a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.

The LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.

The tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate.

Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.

Other forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.

“It just feels like you’re in prison. We don’t even know what they’re gonna throw at us,” Martinez said.

They have been rerouting vessels via longer, costlier routes around Africa since November 2023, following attacks on commercial ships by Yemen's Houthi forces, reportedly in solidarity with Palestinians during warfare in Gaza.

A ceasefire agreement reached in October has led some companies to explore resumption plans, although security remains a key concern. Below are the latest updates:

MAERSK (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab

The Danish shipping company said on Friday that one of its vessels successfully navigated the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait for the first time in nearly two years.

Maersk said it has no immediate plans to fully reopen the route and it is not considering a wider East-West network change back to the trans-Suez corridor, but considers the feat a "stepwise approach" to resuming passage.

The world's third-largest container shipping line, which has made limited Suez transits when security allows, will use the passage for its India-U.S. INDAMEX service from January, according to a schedule published on its website.

HAPAG-LLOYD (HLAG.DE) , opens new tab

Earlier in December, the German shipping group's CEO said the return of the shipping industry to the Suez Canal would be gradual and there would be a transition period of 60-90 days to adjust logistics and avoid sudden port congestion.

The world's fifth-largest container company did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk had called for caution in November, saying they were monitoring the situation for evidence of increased security.

Farmers have been blocking roads, dumping manure and holding demonstrations in France for over a week to protest against the government's management of cattle lumpy skin disease and a trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur .

Farmers gathered with tractors early on Friday in front of President Emmanuel Macron's residence in the seaside resort of Le Touquet in northern France, placing a coffin labelled "RIP Agri" and "NO Mercosur".

Meanwhile, in the southern town of Avignon, farmers threw potatoes at public buildings.

Protesters argue that the government's policy of culling an entire herd when lumpy skin disease is detected is excessive and cruel. They also claim the EU-Mercosur deal whose signing has been postponed to January would allow massive imports of products not meeting French standards.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu is holding meetings with the main farm unions. The head of the FNSEA, the country's largest, said Lecornu committed to sending a letter by evening with answers to a range of agricultural issues.

"This letter will be decisive," FNSEA Chairman Arnaud Rousseau told reporters, adding that the union would then make a decision on whether to suspend the protests.

Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon said on RTL radio that the government would no longer tolerate further blockades and would do "everything necessary" to avoid them.

Young Farmers union President Pierrick Horel said it would observe a Christmas truce.

However, it was still unclear if unions Coordination rurale and the Confederation Paysanne, which have led the blockades, would call off protests.

Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard was due to travel to a farm near Paris later in the day.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7JXOZDZOZMNDAXSPF5VJ26HMM.jpg?auth=4f2fff9231b953d71e0c51070fe6ee0d6b3c8b95b6a66ecd1e14261db0034777&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nine injured in attack in Taipei, media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/several-injured-attack-taipei-media-reports-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:42:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/several-injured-attack-taipei-media-reports-2025-12-19/</guid><description>TAIPEI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Nine people have been injured, four of them seriously, after a person released smoke bombs at a Taipei subway station and then attacked bystanders, the official Central News Agency said.

The latest assessment by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification comes four months after it said 514,000 people - nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza - were experiencing famine . It warned on Friday that the situation in the enclave remained critical.

"Under a worst-case scenario, which would include renewed hostilities and a halt in humanitarian and commercial inflows, the entire Gaza Strip is at risk of famine through mid-April 2026. This underscores the severe and ongoing humanitarian crisis," the IPC said in the report.

Israel controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, in August disputed that there was famine in Gaza. COGAT says 600-800 trucks have entered Gaza daily since the start of the truce in October and that food made up 70% of all those supplies.

Hamas disputes those figures, saying far fewer than 600 trucks a day have made it into Gaza. Aid agencies have repeatedly said far more aid needs to get into Gaza and have said Israel is blocking needed items from entering, which Israel denies.

The IPC said five famines have been confirmed in the past 15 years: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, Sudan in 2024, and most recently in Gaza in August.

For a region to be classified as in famine at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.

"No areas are classified in famine," the IPC said of Gaza on Friday. "The situation remains highly fragile and is contingent on sustained, expanded, and consistent humanitarian and commercial access."

Even if a region has not been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine households are suffering catastrophic conditions, which it describes as an extreme lack of food, starvation and significantly increased risks of acute malnutrition and death.

The IPC said on Friday that more than 100,000 people in Gaza were experiencing catastrophic conditions, but projected that figure to decline to around 1,900 people by April 2026. It said the entire Gaza Strip was classified in an emergency phase, one step below catastrophic conditions.

"Over the next 12 months, across the entire Gaza Strip, nearly 101,000 children aged 6–59 months are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, with more than 31,000 severe cases," the IPC said.

"During the same period, 37,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will also face acute malnutrition and require treatment," it said.

In Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, doctors fear for Arjwan al-Dahini, age 4, and Yasser Arafat, 6. Both children are critically ill with severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous stage of hunger, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra.

Arjwan's mother, Hanin, said her child had not been sick before the war when she walked and played with her brothers. As the family struggled to find food, Arjwan stopped walking and growing and has lost around half her body weight, Hanin said.

“My husband’s arm was amputated and we have no income or anyone to provide for us. How am I supposed to provide for Arjwan and buy her food? I can barely manage to get by,” she said.

Arafat’s brother already died of malnutrition, said Farra, the doctor, and his father is unwell and malnourished too. His mother, Iman, said the family had been unable to buy eggs or other high-protein foods. “He doesn’t run around like other children do. His height remains the same. He’s short,” she said.

The head of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, Mohammed Abu Selmia, said medics had noticed an improvement but that malnutrition was still very widespread. Of 6,000 children screened by the Health Ministry, around 1,000 were malnourished and 100 of them required hospitalization, he said.

“Malnutrition continues to affect children, pregnant women and the elderly,” he said, pointing to a lack of affordable foodstuffs rich in protein and fats. Many babies are born in poor health in Gaza, he said, causing long-term worries about their future.

Antoine Renard, the top U.N. World Food Programme official in Gaza and the West Bank, said there were signs of improvement in the dire hunger situation in Gaza.

"The fact that most of the population is having two meals per day is actually a clear sign that we are actually having a bit of reversal," he told reporters on Thursday.

However, he said it was "a constant struggle" to get streamlined access to Gaza at scale and speed with humanitarian and commercial trucks facing congestion at the border crossings.

The United Nations and aid groups also warned on Wednesday that humanitarian operations in Gaza were at risk of collapse if Israel does not lift impediments that include a "vague, arbitrary, and highly politicized" registration process.

The International Rescue Committee’s Zoe Daniels said high food prices meant it was hard for many people in Gaza to obtain enough high-quality food even when it was available in the market, while Jolien Veldwijk of CARE said the situation in Gaza had not improved as much as it should have.

"People are relying on canned food that is pre-cooked or community kitchens, and they don’t hold the nutritional value that is needed for people to recover from malnutrition,” Veldwijk said.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/326LXED5OJNYDCRSQICZGSL64A.jpg?auth=dba8ecb93ecc420bfd5cf1e1317b45d443f7e09048cc9c02a46dc24d4ea549bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sarcastic messages flash up on big screen as Russia's Putin speaks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/sarcastic-messages-flash-up-big-screen-russias-putin-speaks-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:42:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/sarcastic-messages-flash-up-big-screen-russias-putin-speaks-2025-12-19/</guid><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - Sarcastic messages briefly flashed up on a big screen in the hall where Russian President Vladimir Putin was holding his annual press conference and "direct line" phone-in on Friday.

"Not a direct line, but a circus," said one such comment.

Another, using Putin's first name and patronymic, read: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, it's Friday already, can we break out the booze?"

The rogue comments appeared on screens showing incoming text messages intended for Putin at the marathon annual event, for which ordinary Russians are encouraged to submit questions.

The Kremlin did not immediately comment on their appearance at what is a meticulously planned and choreographed press conference watched by millions of Russians. Putin did not refer to them.

One message, alluding to the state of Russia's economy, asked why ordinary Russians were worse off than people in Papua New Guinea.

Another, referring to Putin's governing United Russia party, said: "Looking at life in the country, it is strange that (it) wins a majority in elections!

The proposed Cape Froward National Park, on the Brunswick Peninsula at the southern tip of the Americas, would span roughly 150,000 hectares of forests, peatlands, glaciers and coastline facing the Strait of Magellan.

"The Brunswick Peninsula is a mosaic of marine, coastal and land ecosystems," said Benjamín Caceres, Rewilding Chile’s wildlife coordinator, adding that human activity, from industry to tourism, must be regulated to prevent harm to fragile ecosystems.

“These are resilient places that maintain balance and create a refuge for species that are in danger of extinction."

Rewilding Chile, a foundation set up by the late philanthropist and founder of the North Face outdoor clothing company Douglas Tompkins, donated about 127,000 hectares of land to the Chilean government in November with the condition that the national park would be created within two years.

The park would shelter the southernmost continental population of the endangered huemul deer and its productive waters support a vast marine food chain including whales, sea lions and orcas.

Project coordinator Gabriela Garrido said authorities hope to finalize the decree in coming months, adding the park to an 8 million-hectare biological corridor in Patagonia that includes the Kawesqar and Alberto de Agostini National Parks.

Rewilding director Carolina Morgado said the park aimed to be a sustainable source of economic development in the region as it would be the first within the municipality of Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile's southernmost region.

The foundation is working on plans for the park to include hiking trails, facilities and camping zones for tourists.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U6EX7LEH2RL67PUCXBHQQORUE4.jpg?auth=be36c52455b34e3b8cb5df2c4b904bffde406d2e1d7a349bc869fbbbed799c2d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo names new leader of the Catholic Church in London</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-names-new-leader-catholic-church-london-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:40:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-names-new-leader-catholic-church-london-2025-12-19/</guid><description>LONDON/VATICAN CITY, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Friday named Bishop Richard Moth as the new Archbishop of Westminster, the most prominent Catholic figure in England and Wales.

Moth will replace Cardinal Vincent Nichols who held the post for 16 years and who turned 80, the mandatory retirement age for Catholic bishops, in November.

The 67-year-old was born in Zambia but moved to England at an early age. His profile on the website of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in south England, where he has been bishop, states that he has previously served as bishop of the armed forces and has been outspoken on the running of prisons.

"I am moved greatly by the trust that Pope Leo has placed in me," Moth said in a statement. " I look forward to continuing the great adventure that is the life of the Church and witness to the Gospel."

The appointment comes a day after the Vatican shook up the leadership of the U.S. church .

Moth takes the helm as Catholicism is gaining ground, especially among younger worshippers . A Bible Society/YouGov report this year found Catholics now outnumber Anglicans among churchgoers aged 18–34 in England and Wales, with 41% identifying as Catholic, compared with 20% who say they are Anglican, reversing 2018 levels.

The appointment also comes amid warming ties between Rome and London, marked by King Charles and Pope Leo praying together in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel this year in the first joint worship by an English monarch and a Catholic pontiff in nearly five centuries.

The announcement also follows the Church of England's naming of Sarah Mullally as its first female Archbishop of Canterbury in October. The Catholic Church has an all-male clergy.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XPCNRIOTXZOXNMHI7YFSKOXZVY.jpg?auth=edc07abeb08b7a48886bb01fe65edfa5a9af6ddde72c86ccd9beb160f0b215f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian defense firms targeted by hackers using AI, other tactics</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defense-firms-targeted-by-hackers-using-ai-other-tactics-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:19:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defense-firms-targeted-by-hackers-using-ai-other-tactics-2025-12-19/</guid><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - Russian technology companies working on air defense, sensitive electronics and other defense applications were targeted in recent weeks by a cyber espionage group using AI-generated decoy documents, according to a cybersecurity analyst.

The discovery by cybersecurity firm Intezer shows how AI tools can be easily harnessed for high-stakes operations, senior security researcher Nicole Fishbein said, and offers a rare look at hacking campaigns targeting Russian entities.

The campaign, not previously reported, is likely the work of a group tracked as either "Paper Werewolf" or GOFFEE, Fishbein said, a hacking group active since 2022 that is widely thought to be pro-Ukrainian and has focused nearly all of its efforts on Russian targets.

The hack also suggests just how aggressively Ukraine and its allies are pursuing a military advantage in the war, which has included drone attacks on defense supply chain entities in recent months. And it has come to light as delicate negotiations play out over a potential end to Russia's war in Ukraine, with Moscow threatening to take more land by force if Kyiv and its European allies do not engage with U.S. proposals for peace.

The hacking campaign targeted several Russian companies, according to suspected AI-generated decoy documents discovered by Fishbein, who is the lead author of an analysis prepared by Intezer , opens new tab .

The Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

In one case, an apparently AI-generated document purports to be an invitation, written in Russian, to a concert for high-ranking officers. In another case, a document purports to be sent from the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, asking for price justification under government regulations around pricing, according to the analysis.

Fishbein said the campaign stands out as a rare opportunity to examine attacks on Russian entities. "This isn't necessarily because those attacks are rare, but because visibility into them is limited," she said.

The group's use of AI-generated decoy documents also demonstrates how "accessible AI tools can be repurposed for malicious goals," Fishbein said. "(It) shows how emerging technologies can lower the barrier for sophisticated attacks and why misuse, not the technology itself, remains the core problem."

The targets, which are all major defense contractors, indicate the attackers' broad interest in Russia's military industry, said Oleg Shakirov, a Russia cyber policy researcher, while potential access to the contractors could offer visibility into "the production of everything from scopes to air defense systems, but also into defense supply chains and R&amp;amp;D processes.

"(There's) nothing unusual about pro-Ukrainian hackers trying to spy on Russian defense companies during the war," Shakirov added, while suggesting that Paper Werewolf may have expanded its targeting beyond government agencies, energy, finance and telecoms to other sectors.

While Intezer attributed the operation to Paper Werewolf, based on the infrastructure supporting the effort, the particular software vulnerabilities exploited, and how the decoy documents were constructed, Fishbein said it was an open question whether the hackers were working with a specific nation-state or other hacking group.

Others, however, have suggested a link between the group and other known pro-Ukrainian hacking efforts. A September 2025 report published by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said Paper Werewolf has potential overlaps with Cloud Atlas, a pro-Ukrainian hacking group dating back more than a decade. The group is known for targeting pro-Russian entities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to cybersecurity firm Check Point.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IFT4DJKQAVLKVHIWN6NTL3OZQA.jpg?auth=f24881fd804ed8d41d8fe91d7f3b4b9a8a2c72e935e8e7beb0ce2f0bf9d95204&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Staff calls off strike at Paris Louvre museum for now - union</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/staff-calls-off-strike-paris-louvre-museum-now-union-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:19:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/staff-calls-off-strike-paris-louvre-museum-now-union-2025-12-19/</guid><description>PARIS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Staff at France's Louvre museum in Paris has voted to call off a strike they began on Monday over pay and working conditions, union representatives said on Friday.

"At a general meeting held today, Louvre Museum staff unanimously decided to pause their action in order to allow the museum to reopen and welcome visitors," the statement from the CFDT-Culture union said.

The museum was entirely closed on Monday as staff walked out and partly reopened from Wednesday. Tuesday is the museum's weekly closure day.

Trade unions said they condemn "the lack of concrete answers regarding the security plan and the future of the establishment, in a context of dilapidation and deteriorating working conditions"

They also regretted "the silence of the museum's president, who has neither met with staff nor issued a statement"

That legislation followed months of political wrangling as well as rebellion by some of Trump's staunchest supporters over his administration's months-long reluctance to make the records public.

It remains unclear how, or when, the files will be released on Friday, but they will likely not represent all unclassified records held by the agency. The law allowed the Justice Department to withhold personal information about Epstein's victims as well as any material that would jeopardize an active investigation.

Attorneys in the Justice Department's National Security Division were ordered to review the materials and redact them in preparation for their release, two sources briefed on the matter said.

They have been working on the task since after the Thanksgiving holiday and were ordered to prioritize it over other casework. But due to the quick turnaround time, some are nervous about potential mistakes and the chance that some personally identifiable information could accidentally remain, the sources said.

Trump had initially urged Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, to oppose the law, arguing that releasing potentially sensitive internal investigative records could set a dangerous precedent. He publicly reversed course just before the vote, even as the White House quietly lobbied senators to slow-walk passage of the bill.

But many Trump voters accused his administration of covering up Epstein's ties to powerful figures and obscuring details surrounding his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail, where he was awaiting trial on charges of abusing and trafficking underage girls. While Epstein's death was ruled a suicide, it sparked years of conspiracy theories, some amplified by Trump himself to his supporters when he was a presidential candidate.

If the Justice Department does not release all of its files, it is likely that many Trump supporters will still not be satisfied. That could mean the issue remains a political headache for the president and his Republican Party heading into tough midterm congressional elections next year.

Just 44% of American adults who identify as Republicans approve of Trump's handling of the Epstein issue, compared to his 82% overall approval rating among the group, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll .

Last month, Democrats in the House of Representatives released thousands of emails obtained from Epstein's estate, including one in which Epstein wrote that Trump "knew about the girls," without clarifying what that meant. Trump, in response, accused Democrats of promoting the "Epstein Hoax" as a distraction.

House Republicans released more emails the same day, including one saying Trump visited Epstein's house many times but "never got a massage."

Trump was once friendly with Epstein until they had a falling out in the mid-2000s, before Epstein's first conviction in 2008. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied knowing about Epstein's sex trafficking.

But he reneged on a 2024 campaign promise to declassify the government's Epstein files if elected, prompting some lawmakers to launch what at first was seen as a long-shot effort to force a vote on disclosure.

Two days after Congress' email releases, Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's connections to Democratic former President Bill Clinton and JPMorgan &lt; JPM.N &gt;, in what critics viewed as an effort to shift the focus away from himself.

The following week, despite White House pressure to delay the vote, U.S. lawmakers passed a bill forcing the release of the Justice Department records, which Trump then signed into law.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6AHJWB6EBJJ4BEIMRB7JPBCE4M.jpg?auth=d038103d672a71743e20e81f7be930b770439dc1a06a3bed919e4e567e5a634e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin warns of risks for top oil producers' reserves in EU</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-warns-risks-top-oil-producers-reserves-eu-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:50:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-warns-risks-top-oil-producers-reserves-eu-2025-12-19/</guid><description>MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Friday of risks for international reserves held by the world's top oil producers in the European Union, following discussions by EU leaders about using Russian assets to finance Ukraine.

Putin's remarks were aimed at some of the world's largest reserve holders, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as other OPEC countries.

EU leaders decided on Friday to borrow cash to lend 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine to finance its defence against Russia for the next two years, rather than use frozen Russian assets.

Putin said that a seizure of the Russian assets, which he called "a robbery", had to be cancelled because it would have had grave consequences for EU member states.

"This is not just a blow to its image; it is an undermining of trust in the euro zone. The fact is that many countries keep their gold and foreign exchange reserves in the euro zone, not only Russia but first and foremost the oil-producing countries," Putin said.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W3BYQQRJFRI7RBESBINZXJ3HS4.jpg?auth=4b7b0a78b05f1ac8ffcd715506c3450456529d6d13c9f121dff2d4a3b6e4b0c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia, Ukraine carry out new exchange of bodies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-carry-out-new-exchange-bodies-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:50:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-carry-out-new-exchange-bodies-2025-12-19/</guid><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Russia have carried out a new exchange of bodies of dead soldiers, Ukrainian and Russian officials said on Friday.

Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky said Russia had handed over to Ukraine the remains of 1,000 Ukrainian servicemen and had received the bodies of 26 Russian soldiers from Kyiv.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that Kyiv had received 1,003 bodies of killed servicemen from Russia. They said that investigators and experts would work to conduct all necessary examinations and identify them.

Ukraine's prisoner-of-war coordination center posted on the Telegram app pictures of several large trucks and people in protective overalls checking bodies in white sacks.

Since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022, Kyiv and Moscow have conducted regular exchanges of the bodies of the killed servicemen.

Authorities in both countries have been generally tight-lipped about the overall numbers of soldiers killed and wounded.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he is not ruling out war with Venezuela, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-is-not-ruling-out-war-with-venezuela-nbc-news-reports-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:50:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-is-not-ruling-out-war-with-venezuela-nbc-news-reports-2025-12-19/</guid><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was leaving the possibility of war with Venezuela on the table, according to an interview with NBC News published on Friday.

But his endorsement of his eldest son this month raised doubts if the ex-president still has the heft to hold his right-wing coalition together.

Barred from seeking public office since 2023 and now serving a 27-year sentence for a failed coup plot , the hard-right firebrand stunned allies and investors by throwing his weight behind a presidential run by his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro.

Financial markets plunged on the news. Many investors had bet the ex-president would back a more seasoned candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas , his former minister, to challenge leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

While the 44-year-old Flavio Bolsonaro quickly got public backing from his siblings and their political party, other conservative powerbrokers have been slow to throw their weight behind him.

Freitas, 50, was publicly silent on the matter for over 48 hours before telling reporters the senator "can count on us."

The lukewarm response in Brasilia and jitters in the market have emboldened a crowd of other right-wing politicians with presidential ambitions and made clear how fragmented the opposition is less than a year before the October 2026 election.

"The Bolsonaros expected that once their father decided, everybody would bow down and go with it," said political analyst Thomas Traumann. "(But) besides the obvious ones, his party, nobody came out and said 'What a great idea!'"

The ex-president's endorsement may even be more damaging than helpful. Half of Brazilians say they would not vote for a candidate supported by Jair Bolsonaro next year, according to a Datafolha poll conducted days before he endorsed his son.

The younger Bolsonaro may also struggle to make his case purely in terms of electoral competitiveness with Lula, 80, who is seeking a fourth presidential term next year.

The Datafolha survey and a more recent one by pollster AtlasIntel both showed Senator Bolsonaro trailing Lula by double digits in a simulated matchup, while Freitas was four or five percentage points behind.

A survey by pollster Quaest showed Senator Bolsonaro, Freitas and center-right Parana Governor Ratinho Junior all polling 10 percentage points behind Lula in direct matchups, while others mooted as candidates such as governors Ronaldo Caiado of Goias and Romeu Zema of Minas Gerais lagged slightly more.

A senator who identifies as center-right, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Flavio Bolsonaro would have a harder time than other candidates unifying the right.

Senator Bolsonaro has nonetheless made his case in recent weeks to centrist party chieftains and business leaders, calling himself "a more moderate, balanced and centered Bolsonaro."

He has floated market-friendly names as references for his economic plans, but a definition of his agenda and advisers will take months, according to people familiar with his thinking.

While the younger Bolsonaro prioritizes bridge-building on the center-right, he will also face challenges from ideological upstarts that grew out of his father's right-wing coalition.

"The decision by the Bolsonaro camp to back Flavio Bolsonaro sparked widespread dissatisfaction, not only across the broader right but even within the hardcore Bolsonaro base itself," said Congressman Kim Kataguiri, one of the founders of the young, conservative Free Brazil Movement (MBL), which broke with the ex-president in 2019.

"Even within bolsonarismo there are divisions," he said.

Kataguiri, 29, said he expects rejection of Flavio Bolsonaro to open space for the candidacy of 41-year-old Renan Santos, a fellow MBL founder who has vowed to fight corruption and organized crime.

Some conservative strategists warn a fractured field could leave the opposition unprepared to confront Lula.

"If the center-right and the right are not united, there's a great chance we lose the election," said Paulo Kramer, a political scientist who worked on Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6M3WJ5HG7VLR5L3X2BQTKE7S7U.jpg?auth=1f764664100c37572c1d235812f5fd718128c763bffa8f064fb4027ba6fb993c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin says Russia does not believe Ukraine is ready for peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-russia-does-not-believe-ukraine-is-ready-peace-talks-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 09:46:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-russia-does-not-believe-ukraine-is-ready-peace-talks-2025-12-19/</guid><description>MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told his annual press conference on Friday that Moscow does not believe Ukraine is ready for peace talks.

The ministry said it had lodged "stern representations" with the United States, and urged the country to immediately cease arms sales to Taiwan and abide by its commitment not to support "Taiwan independence forces".

"The 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces, at the cost of the safety and well-being of Taiwan compatriots, use the hard-earned money of ordinary people to fatten U.S. arms dealers in an attempt to 'seek independence by relying on military force'," the ministry statement said.

The United States, by repeatedly going back on its word, indulging and supporting Taiwan independence, is "bound to get burned itself," the ministry added.

"The Chinese People's Liberation Army will continue to strengthen training and combat readiness, take strong measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely frustrate attempts at 'Taiwan independence' separatism and external interference."

It did not give details on what exact steps it might take.

Washington has formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island's most important arms supplier. The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

The latest weapons package includes HIMARS rocket systems, made by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab and which have been used extensively by Ukraine against Russian forces.

Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

China has rebuffed repeated offers of talks with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, saying he is a "separatist". It has not ruled out the use of force to take control of the island.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Venezuela's billions in distressed debt: who is in line to collect</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-billions-distressed-debt-who-is-line-collect-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 09:27:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-billions-distressed-debt-who-is-line-collect-2025-12-19/</guid><description>NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s debt crisis is one of the largest unresolved sovereign defaults in the world, the legacy of years of economic collapse and U.S. sanctions that severed the country from international capital markets.

The country has been in default since late 2017, when it missed payments on international bonds issued by the government and state oil company PDVSA. Since then, unpaid principal, accumulated interest and legal claims tied to past expropriations have swollen Venezuela’s total external liabilities far beyond the face value of the original bonds.

A PDVSA bond originally maturing in 2020 was secured by equity in U.S.-based refiner Citgo, an asset now at the center of court-supervised efforts by creditors to recover value.

Venezuela's distressed debt has ticked slightly up recently as some speculators bet on the possibility of political change. Below is a look at what could be included in an eventual restructuring and who would be knocking on Caracas' door to collect.

Analysts estimate that Venezuela has about $60 billion of defaulted bonds outstanding, while total external debt including PDVSA obligations, bilateral loans and arbitration awards stand at roughly $150-$170 billion, depending on how accrued interest and court judgments are counted.

The International Monetary Fund estimates Venezuela's nominal GDP at about $82.8 billion for 2025, so the debt-to-GDP ratio is between 180%-200%.

Years of sanctions, including a prohibition to trade Venezuela’s debt, have made it hard to keep tabs on who holds what. The largest share of commercial creditors likely consists of international bondholders, including global emerging-market funds and specialist distressed-debt investors sometimes called vulture funds.

Also on the creditors list is a group of companies awarded compensation through international arbitration after assets were expropriated by the government. U.S. courts have upheld multi-billion-dollar awards to ConocoPhillips and Crystallex among others, turning those claims into debt obligations and allowing creditors to pursue Venezuelan assets to make themselves whole.

A growing pool of court-recognized claimants is competing for recovery from Citgo’s parent company through U.S. legal proceedings. A Delaware court registered about $19 billion in claims for the auction of PDV Holding, Citgo's parent, which far exceeds the estimated value of Citgo's total assets.

Caracas also has bilateral creditors, primarily China and Russia, which extended loans to both President Nicolas Maduro and his mentor, former president Hugo Chavez. Precise outstanding balances are hard to verify - Venezuela has not published comprehensive debt statistics in years.

Despite periodic market rallies of late , a formal restructuring remains distant.

A sovereign debt workout could be anchored by an IMF program setting fiscal targets and debt-sustainability assumptions, but Venezuela has not had an IMF annual consultation in nearly two decades and remains locked out of the lender’s financing.

U.S. sanctions are another obstacle. Since 2017, restrictions imposed under both Republican and Democratic administrations have sharply limited the government’s ability to issue or restructure debt without explicit licenses from the U.S. Treasury.

Relations between Washington and Caracas have swung between hostile pressure and limited engagement. During President Donald Trump’s first term, sanctions escalated alongside U.S. recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido.

Former President Joe Biden's administration eased some restrictions to encourage electoral commitments, but stopped short of granting broad authorization for debt talks. U.S. action since Trump returned to office has included military pressure in the Caribbean, seizure of an oil cargo, threats of an oil blockade and a land attack.

Investors are increasingly focused on what a future restructuring deal could look like.

Bonds have returned near 100% at the index level this year. The rally got a second wind in September, alongside the ratcheted-up U.S. military presence in the Caribbean.

Citi analysts said last month that Venezuela’s debt rally reflects expectations that political change could eventually unlock restructuring talks. Based on their assumptions, a principal haircut of at least 50% would be needed to restore debt sustainability and satisfy potential conditions from the IMF.

Under Citi’s base case, Venezuela could offer creditors a 20-year bond with a coupon around 4.4%, alongside a 10-year zero-coupon instrument to compensate for past-due interest. Using an exit yield of 11%, Citi estimates the net present value of the package in the mid-40s cents on the dollar, with recoveries potentially rising into the high-40s if investors receive additional contingent instruments such as oil-linked warrants.

Other investors sketch a wider range. Aberdeen Investments said in September it had initially assumed recoveries of around 25 cents on the dollar for Venezuelan bonds, but that improved political and sanctions scenarios could lift recoveries into the low-to-mid-30s, depending on the structure of any deal and the use of oil-linked or GDP-style instruments.

Recovery assumptions sit against a grim backdrop . Venezuela’s economy shrank dramatically after 2013 when oil production fell off a cliff, inflation spiraled and poverty surged. Although output has stabilized somewhat, lower global oil prices and discounts to Venezuela's crude prices limit revenue gains, leaving little room to service debt without deep restructuring. The recent U.S. blockade of sanctioned oil tankers strikes at the heart of what is left of the Venezuelan economy.

Millions of Venezuelans have left their country in search of opportunities elsewhere, adding brain drain to the rebuilding uncertainty.</description><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PGIR6FR2RZJVBJODDM3VG57SBE.jpg?auth=3896957f873654e1a15c31144a4fff97e1dec29f2e38deb32f61d143539622db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" length="0" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hundreds of migrants land in Greece after search operation at sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hundreds-migrants-land-greece-after-search-operation-sea-2025-12-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 09:27:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.reuters.com/world/hundreds-migrants-land-greece-after-search-operation-sea-2025-12-19/</guid><description /></item><item><title>2025: When Gen-Z street protests toppled Nepal's govt</title><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/2025-when-gen-z-street-protests-toppled-nepals-govt/articleshow/126199785.cms</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/2025-when-gen-z-street-protests-toppled-nepals-govt/articleshow/126199785.cms</guid><description>Nepal faced major political unrest in 2025.

Europe will need to engage with Putin if US peace talks fail</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-says-europe-will-need-engage-with-putin-if-us-peace-talks-fail-2025-12-19/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Europe will have to re-engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin if the latest U.S.-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal founder, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday. European leaders wary of Putin's future military ambitions have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine's negotiating positions from the sidelines. "Either a robust and lasting peace is reached, with the required (security) guarantees," Macron told reporters in Brussels, "or we will need in the weeks ahead to find ways for Europeans to re-engage in a fulsome dialogue with Russia, and in complete transparency." The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Macron was speaking after EU leaders agreed to fund Ukraine with a 90 billion euro ($105.44 billion) loan backed by the bloc's own budget rather than frozen Russian assets, with divisions between member states proving too tricky to overcome. The French president said the EU could not deprive itself of a direct line to Moscow if Trump's administration had one. U.S. officials are due to hold talks with Russian negotiators in Miami this weekend. Most EU countries, with the exception of Hungary and Slovakia, have severed communication with Putin since he invaded Ukraine. Macron held a two-hour phone call with Putin in July, the first in three years, in which he called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but the conversation had little discernible impact on the war. The bloc had an interest in finding the right framework to re-engage in talks with Russia, Macron said, or else its leaders risked being left talking amongst themselves and "with negotiators who alone will talk to the Russians." Some EU leaders warn it is increasingly tough to maintain hitherto high levels of public support for sustaining Ukraine's war effort. EU leaders in Brussels had been determined to avert the risk of Kyiv going bankrupt next year because it sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a threat to its own security. But most had hoped to use immobilised Russian assets to do so, and not their own cash.

European leaders wary of Putin's future military ambitions have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine's negotiating positions from the sidelines. "Either a robust and lasting peace is reached, with the required (security) guarantees," Macron told reporters in Brussels, "or we will need in the weeks ahead to find ways for Europeans to re-engage in a fulsome dialogue with Russia, and in complete transparency." The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Macron was speaking after EU leaders agreed to fund Ukraine with a 90 billion euro ($105.44 billion) loan backed by the bloc's own budget rather than frozen Russian assets, with divisions between member states proving too tricky to overcome. The French president said the EU could not deprive itself of a direct line to Moscow if Trump's administration had one. U.S. officials are due to hold talks with Russian negotiators in Miami this weekend. Most EU countries, with the exception of Hungary and Slovakia, have severed communication with Putin since he invaded Ukraine. Macron held a two-hour phone call with Putin in July, the first in three years, in which he called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but the conversation had little discernible impact on the war. The bloc had an interest in finding the right framework to re-engage in talks with Russia, Macron said, or else its leaders risked being left talking amongst themselves and "with negotiators who alone will talk to the Russians." Some EU leaders warn it is increasingly tough to maintain hitherto high levels of public support for sustaining Ukraine's war effort. EU leaders in Brussels had been determined to avert the risk of Kyiv going bankrupt next year because it sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a threat to its own security. But most had hoped to use immobilised Russian assets to do so, and not their own cash. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the summit deal showed Europe could deliver when needed but that some EU governments were under mounting political pressure at home. "This is what Putin is hoping for, the combination of some kind of war fatigue with a hybrid war that brings a lot of uncertainty and insecurity into our societies," Frederiksen told reporters after the summit.

He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year. Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation. “We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted. He recalled that Pakistan shot down seven jets of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for intercepting 79 out of 80 drones sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours. The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the Pulwama and the Pahalgam incidents. “This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said. Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10. “The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s retaliatory operation. “After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that. Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.” Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’. “Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled. He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire. “It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said. “Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons. “Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.” The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”. Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir. On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others. Ice breaks with Bangladesh The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived. Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had visited Bangladesh in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there. “My 36-hour visit to Bangladesh was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed. “During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls. “Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said. Positive ties with US Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire. “That is why on June 11, we nominated [President Donald] Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said. “President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped. “Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.</description><pubDate>2025-12-27T12:47:52</pubDate><enclosure url="https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715373259eea97.webp" type="image/jpeg" /><ns0:thumbnail url="https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715373259eea97.webp" /></item><item><title>Macron says Europe will need to engage with Putin if US peace talks fail</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-says-europe-will-need-engage-with-putin-if-us-peace-talks-fail-2025-12-19/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Europe will have to re-engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin if the latest U.S.-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal founder, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.

The Trump administration has sent thousands of troops to the region, along with an aircraft carrier, warships and fighter jets. "We're not concerned about an escalation with Russia, with regards to Venezuela," Rubio told reporters. "We've always expected them to provide rhetorical support for the Maduro regime... (but) it's not a factor in how we consider this whole thing," Rubio added. Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it hoped that Trump's administration would not make a fatal mistake over Venezuela and said Moscow was concerned about U.S. decisions that threatened international shipping. While Venezuela and Russia have close ties, a recent strategy document from Trump said the United States will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere and argued that the U.S. should revive the 19th century Monroe Doctrine , which declared the Western Hemisphere to be Washington's zone of influence. The Trump administration has also carried out strikes against suspected drug vessels in the region, seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, and declared a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Trump has also repeatedly said that strikes on land in Venezuela are coming soon. Democratic lawmakers have said that the Trump administration has provided limited information about the operations in the region. "Nothing has happened that requires us to notify Congress or get congressional approval or cross the threshold into war," Rubio said. He said there were strikes against suspected drug vessels that the administration did not go ahead with because it failed to meet their criteria. "We know who's on those boats. We've been tracking them from the very beginning," said Rubio. "We know everything about them, okay?

European leaders wary of Putin's future military ambitions have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine's negotiating positions from the sidelines. "Either a robust and lasting peace is reached, with the required (security) guarantees," Macron told reporters in Brussels, "or we will need in the weeks ahead to find ways for Europeans to re-engage in a fulsome dialogue with Russia, and in complete transparency." The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Macron was speaking after EU leaders agreed to fund Ukraine with a 90 billion euro ($105.44 billion) loan backed by the bloc's own budget rather than frozen Russian assets, with divisions between member states proving too tricky to overcome. The French president said the EU could not deprive itself of a direct line to Moscow if Trump's administration had one. U.S. officials are due to hold talks with Russian negotiators in Miami this weekend. Most EU countries, with the exception of Hungary and Slovakia, have severed communication with Putin since he invaded Ukraine. Macron held a two-hour phone call with Putin in July, the first in three years, in which he called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but the conversation had little discernible impact on the war. The bloc had an interest in finding the right framework to re-engage in talks with Russia, Macron said, or else its leaders risked being left talking amongst themselves and "with negotiators who alone will talk to the Russians." Some EU leaders warn it is increasingly tough to maintain hitherto high levels of public support for sustaining Ukraine's war effort. EU leaders in Brussels had been determined to avert the risk of Kyiv going bankrupt next year because it sees Russia's war in Ukraine as a threat to its own security. But most had hoped to use immobilised Russian assets to do so, and not their own cash. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the summit deal showed Europe could deliver when needed but that some EU governments were under mounting political pressure at home. "This is what Putin is hoping for, the combination of some kind of war fatigue with a hybrid war that brings a lot of uncertainty and insecurity into our societies," Frederiksen told reporters after the summit.

The Trump administration has sent thousands of troops to the region, along with an aircraft carrier, warships and fighter jets. "We're not concerned about an escalation with Russia, with regards to Venezuela," Rubio told reporters. "We've always expected them to provide rhetorical support for the Maduro regime... (but) it's not a factor in how we consider this whole thing," Rubio added. Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it hoped that Trump's administration would not make a fatal mistake over Venezuela and said Moscow was concerned about U.S. decisions that threatened international shipping. While Venezuela and Russia have close ties, a recent strategy document from Trump said the United States will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere and argued that the U.S. should revive the 19th century Monroe Doctrine , which declared the Western Hemisphere to be Washington's zone of influence. The Trump administration has also carried out strikes against suspected drug vessels in the region, seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, and declared a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Trump has also repeatedly said that strikes on land in Venezuela are coming soon. Democratic lawmakers have said that the Trump administration has provided limited information about the operations in the region. "Nothing has happened that requires us to notify Congress or get congressional approval or cross the threshold into war," Rubio said. He said there were strikes against suspected drug vessels that the administration did not go ahead with because it failed to meet their criteria. "We know who's on those boats. We've been tracking them from the very beginning," said Rubio. "We know everything about them, okay? There are boat strikes we don't take because they don't meet the criteria, the legal criteria."</description><pubDate>2025-12-19T18:57:11</pubDate><enclosure
